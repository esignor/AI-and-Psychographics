# AI-and-Psychographics
*Artificial Intelligence and Psychographics*
Project carried to the Master's degree thesis in Computer Science (september 2022/july 2023, UniPd). 

Can gender and personality be exploited to influence occupational choice? In this thesis, this question is answered by using Machine Learning models for natural language analysis on public Twitter posts, to capture the relationships between gender, Big Five personality traits and occupation. A feasibility study is carried out on the use of psychographic targeting, a socio-demographic communication tool based on personality traits, to influence the choices of certain subjects through ad-hoc developed advertisements. The thesis is applied, in concrete terms, in the study of STEM occupations and in finding a solution to help solve the gender gap.
